# Classifying pancreatic cancer with biomarker data

This project focuses on medical diagnostics using machine learning to distinguish between healthy individuals, patients with non-cancerous pancreatic conditions, and those with pancreatic cancer using urinary biomarker data. 


This project is done in the course Machine Learning D at Aalto University. 


**Grade: 100/100**

### Data source
This project utilizes the Pancreatic Cancer Biomarker Dataset originally published by Debernardi et al. (2020), which contains measurements of specific proteins in urine samples from 590 patients across three diagnostic categories:
- Healthy controls (183 samples)
- Benign pancreatic diseases (208 samples)
- Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (199 samples)


The goal was to develop an accurate, non-invasive screening tool for early pancreatic cancer detection using machine learning classification.
